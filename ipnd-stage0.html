        <h2>The Web</h2>
        <p>
            The <em>web</em> is a collection of computers that communicate with
            each other. When someone views a <em>web page</em> like
            <a href="www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a>, their
            <em>browser</em> sends an <em>HTTP Request</em> (Hyper-Text
            Transfer Protocol) to a <em>server</em>. The server send the
            appropriate HTML document to the user's computer and the browser
            <em>interprets</em> the page and displays it.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            <em>HTML</em> stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <em>HTML
            documents</em> form the majority of the content on the web. HTML
            documents contain textual content describing "what you see" and
            <em>markup</em> describing "what it looks like".
        </p>
        <h2>Tags &amp; Elements</h2>
        <p>
            HTML documents consist of <em>HTML elements</em>. When writing
            HTML, we tell browsers how to render elements using
            <em>HTML tags</em>. Each element consists of an opening tag, a
            closing tag, and content. Tags may also have <em>attributes</em>
            that give further instruction to the browser.
        </p>
        <h2>Computers follow instructions verbatim</h2>
        <p>
            Computers interpret instructions literally. This means that any
            intruction given to a computer needs to be unambiguous. Many bugs
            arise from ambiguous instructions which have been interpreted with
            unexpected results.
        </p>
        <h2>Inline &amp; Block Elements</h2>
        <p>
            HTML elements can be either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.
            Block elements form an "invisible box" around their content, which
            can be manipulated to position content.
